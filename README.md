# GeometricTransformations3DTextured
This app allows you to perform geometric transformations on a 3D cube textured with an image of your choice. It was created using the C++ programming language and the QT framework. Here are the steps to use the app:

1. Turn on the app.
2. A window will pop up. Choose an image in JPG or PNG format. The app works best with images that are 500x500 pixels.
3. The app will display a cube textured with the chosen image.
4. You can perform the following operations on the cube:
    * Use the first 3 sliders to move the cube on the X, Y, and Z axes.
    * Use the next 3 sliders to scale the cube on the X, Y, and Z axes.
    * Use the next 3 sliders to rotate the cube around the X, Y, and Z axes.
    * Use the last 2 sliders to shear the cube on the X and Y axes.
